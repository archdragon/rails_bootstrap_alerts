# RailsBootstrapAlerts

This is a very small gem that allows you to easily use Twitter Bootstrap alerts with flash messages generated by your Rails application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_bootstrap_alerts'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails_bootstrap_alerts

## Usage

This gem installs a #flash_class(flash_name) helper that translates the name of your flash message to it's Bootstrap alert equivalent.

In your layout (ie. layouts/application.erb) you can add #flash_class(key) to your bootstrap div:

      <% flash.each do |key, value| %>
        <div class="<%= flash_class(key) %>"><%= value %></div>
      <% end %>
